                    In the summer of 2020, a group of passionate college students came together with a common mission: <strong>to provide 100% free mentorship and guidance to first-generation high school students in the Ethiopian and Eritrean communities</strong> across the United States. This initiative, known as Egna Le Egna, was born out of our shared desire to pay forward the support and mentorship we received during our own high school journeys.

                <p>
                    Over the past three years, we’ve had the privilege of helping over 120 Ethiopian and Eritrean high school students across the USA. We’ve assisted them in gaining admission to highly selective colleges, earning numerous awards, and securing scholarships. Now, we are taking the next step in our journey by working to officially register Egna Le Egna as a 503(c) non-profit organization.

By contributing to our cause, you are directly empowering first-generation high school students in our communities. <strong>Together, we can help these students overcome challenges, achieve their dreams, and build brighter futures.</strong>
